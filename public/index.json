Their adoption for mod-eling user preferences is still unexplored, although recently it isstarting to gain attention in the current literature. In this work, wepropose a model which extends variational autoencoders by exploit-ing the rich information present in the past preference history. Weintroduce a recurrent version of the VAE, where instead of passinga subset of the whole history regardless of temporal dependencies,we rather pass the consumption sequence subset through a recur-rent neural network. At each time-step of the RNN, the sequence isfed through a series of fully-connected layers, the output of whichmodels the probability distribution of the most likely future prefer-ences. We show that handling temporal information is crucial forimproving the accuracy of the VAE: In fact, our model beats thecurrent state-of-the-art by valuable margins because of its abilityto capture temporal dependencies among the user-consumption se-quence using the recurrent encoder still keeping the fundamentalsof variational autoencoders intact.","tags":[],"title":"Sequential Variational Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Noveen Sachdeva","Kartik Gupta","Vikram Pudi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1538459237,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538459237,"objectID":"2ea80e0f6065a07b802521cf417169b1","permalink":"/publication/recsys_18/","publishdate":"2019-06-02T01:47:17-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/recsys_18/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender Systems are an integral part of music sharing plat-forms. Often the aim of these systems is to increase the time, theuser spends on the platform and hence having a high commercialvalue. The systems which aim at increasing the average time auser spends on the platform often need to recommend songs whichthe user might want to listen to next at each point in time. This isdifferent from recommendation systems which try to predict theitem which might be of interest to the user at some point in theuser lifetime but not necessarily in the very near future. Predictionof next song the user might like requires some kind of modelingof the user interests at the given point of time. Attentive neuralnetworks have been exploiting the sequence in which the itemswere selected by the user to model the implicit short-term interestsof the user for the task of next item prediction, however we feelthat features of the songs occurring in the sequence could also con-vey some important information about the short-term user interestwhich only the items cannot. In this direction we propose a novelattentive neural architecture which in addition to the sequence ofitems selected by the user, uses the features of these items to betterlearn the user short-term preferences and recommend next song tothe user.","tags":[],"title":"Attentive Neural Architecture Incorporating Song Features For Music Recommendation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kartik Gupta","Noveen Sachdeva","Vikram Pudi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1527918437,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1527918437,"objectID":"f8012ccb3e28b0ab1c687669976ae888","permalink":"/publication/ecir_18/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T01:47:17-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ecir_18/","section":"publication","summary":"Recommender systems are a key component of music sharing platforms, which suggest musical recordings a user might like. People often have implicit preferences while listening to music, though these preferences might not always be the same while they listen to music at different times. For example, a user might be interested in listening to songs of only a particular artist at some time, and the same user might be interested in the top-rated songs of a genre at another time. In this paper we try to explicitly model the short term preferences of the user with the help of Last.fm tags of the songs the user has listened to. With a session defined as a period of activity surrounded by periods of inactivity, we introduce the concept of a subsession, which is that part of the session wherein the preference of the user does not change much. We assume the user preference might change within a session and a session might have multiple subsessions. We use our modelling of the user preferences to generate recommendations for the next song the user might listen to. Experiments on the user listening histories taken from Last.fm indicate that this approach beats the present methodologies in predicting the next recording a user might listen to.","tags":[],"title":"Explicit Modelling of the Implicit Short Term User Preferences for Music Recommendation","type":"publication"}]
