I am a PhD student in the CS Department at [**UC San Diego**](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) where I extremely fortunate to be adivsed by [Prof. Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/). My (current) research interests in Machine Learning are Data Mining, NLP, Information Retrieval, Causal Inference, and Reinforcement learning **(in no particular order)**.

Previously, I have worked on building better algorithms for recommender systems, especially for music sharing platforms [[RecSys '18]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240397) [[ECIR '18]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_25), by using the temporal information present in user listening-sequences. 

I am fortunate to have the opportunities of working with some of the pioneers in Machine Learning research. At the **National Research Council of Italy (ICAR-CNR)**, I extended on my previous research on sequential recommender systems [[WSDM '19]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3291007). At **Cornell**, my research on broader topics Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning, focussed on proposing new estimators for off-policy learning under deficient support [[KDD '20]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3394486.3403139). At **UCSD**, I found an intriguing problem in most of the current review based recommender systems, which I aimed to generalize and provide solutions for [[SIGIR '20]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3397271.3401281). More recently, I have been working at **Microsoft Research**, exploring and working towards improving current state-of-art in extreme classification, a field of high utility in most real-world machine learning applications.

I also try to contribute to the open-source community, whenever I can find time. Proud GSoC'17 (Google Summer of Code) student with [ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud), GCI '18 (Google Code-In) mentor with [RedHat](http://www.jboss.org/).

I like to play the guitar, piano, video games, and read books during my free time.
