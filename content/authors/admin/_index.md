Dual-Degree (B.Tech + M.S) student in the Computer Science Department at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/). I am very forunate to be advised by [Prof. Vikram Pudi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vikram/), and be a member of the [Data Science and Analytics Center, KCIS](http://dsac.iiit.ac.in/).

My research so-far has been aligned towards building better algorithms for recommender systems, especially for music sharing services [[RecSys '18]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240397) [[ECIR '18]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_25), by using the temporal information present in user listening-sequences.

I also actively contribute to the open-source community, whenever I can find time. Proud GSoC'17 (Google Summer of Code) student with [ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud), GCI '18 (Google Code-In) mentor with [RedHat](http://www.jboss.org/).

I like to play the guitar, video games and read books during my free time.
