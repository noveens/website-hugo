Final year dual-degree (B.Tech + M.S) student in the CS Department at **IIIT Hyderabad**, where I am advised by [Prof. Vikram Pudi](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~vikram/) at the [Data Science and Analytics Center, KCIS](http://dsac.iiit.ac.in/). My (current) research interests in Machine Learning are Data Mining, NLP, Information Retrieval, Causal Inference, and Reinforcement learning **(in no particular order)**.

Previously, I have worked on building better algorithms for recommender systems, especially for music sharing platforms [[RecSys '18]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3240323.3240397) [[ECIR '18]](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-76941-7_25), by using the temporal information present in user listening-sequences. 

I am fortunate to have the opportunities of working with some of the pioneers in Machine Learning research. At the **National Research Council of Italy (ICAR-CNR)**, I extended on my previous research on sequential recommender systems [[WSDM '19]](https://doi.org/10.1145/3289600.3291007). At **Cornell**, my research on broader topics Causal Inference and Reinforcement Learning, focussed on proposing new estimators for off-policy learning under deficient support [[Preprint]](https://openreview.net/attachment?id=SklcyJBtvB&name=original_pdf). At **UCSD**, I found an intriguing problem in most of the current review based recommender systems, which I aimed to generalize and provide solutions for. More recently, I have been working at **Microsoft Research**, exploring and working on various aspects of extreme classification, a field of high utility in most real-world machine learning applications.

I also try to contribute to the open-source community, whenever I can find time. Proud GSoC'17 (Google Summer of Code) student with [ownCloud](https://github.com/owncloud), GCI '18 (Google Code-In) mentor with [RedHat](http://www.jboss.org/).

I like to play the guitar, video games, and read books during my free time.
